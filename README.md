## Technical Background
I've always loved video games, so when I was in middle school my mom signed me up for beginner "game development" classes during the summers (These ranged from making pong clones to creating Minecraft mods). This naturally got me interested in computer programming. I was later dual-enrolled at GRCC during my junior and senior years of high school where I took classes with the hope of graduating high school with an associates degree in computer programming; Although that never ended up being the case. I am now in my sophomore year at Grand Valley State University studying computer science.
